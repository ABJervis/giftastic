This program features gifs for a chosen subject. In this case, musical instruments. This is a good lesson in API use and directed manipulation of the resulting GIFs. Add whichever instrument you like to the list and click the corresponding button to view related GIFs. You can click the GIF to give it motion and click again to stop.
